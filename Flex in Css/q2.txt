Q2. Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout model
- justify-content;
- align-item;
- flex-direction;
- flex-wrap

ans- justify-content:

This property controls how the flex items are positioned along the main axis of the flex container.
Values include:
flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the flex container.
flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the flex container.
center: Items are centered along the main axis.
space-between: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them, including before the first and after the last item.

align-items:

This property determines how flex items are aligned along the cross axis of the flex container.

Values include:
stretch: Default value. Items are stretched to fill the container.
flex-start: Items are aligned to the start of the cross axis.
flex-end: Items are aligned to the end of the cross axis.
center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
baseline: Items are aligned based on their baselines.

flex-direction:

This property defines the direction of the main axis in the flex container and the direction in which flex items are placed.
Values include:
row: Default value. Main axis runs along the inline direction.
row-reverse: Main axis runs along the inline direction, but in the opposite direction.
column: Main axis runs along the block direction.
column-reverse: Main axis runs along the block direction, but in the opposite direction.

flex-wrap:

This property determines whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
Values include:
nowrap: Default value. All flex items are forced onto a single line.
wrap: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines if needed.
wrap-reverse: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order if needed.

These properties, when used together, provide powerful control over the layout and alignment of flex items within a flex container, allowing for flexible and responsive designs
